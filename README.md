## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have already learned HTML and CSS previously so I used this project to learn about the git and GitHub ecosystem effectively. I learned a lot by actually doing things to gain handson experience on programming and not just watch others do them in tutorials.

### Continued development

In the future, I would love to try out new challenges offered by Frontend Mentor as I found this to be an effective way to learn.

### Useful resources

- [The Official Git scm docs](https://git-scm.com/docs) - This helped me completed the setup of the git for windows software. It's an incredible way to learn about the git commands and really get started with using it.
- [The official GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) - This is such a comprehensive guide to using GitHub. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
